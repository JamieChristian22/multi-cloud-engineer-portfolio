# Shared Multi-Cloud Design Principles

These principles guide every architecture in this portfolio:

- **Secure by default** – least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, strong identity.
- **Well-architected** – reliability, performance, cost optimization, operational excellence.
- **Cloud-agnostic where possible** – patterns that can be implemented on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Automated** – infrastructure as code, repeatable deployments, version-controlled changes.
- **Observable** – metrics, logs, traces, and alerts across all environments and clouds.
